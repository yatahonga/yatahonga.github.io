    <h1 id="6_0">[6.0] SETTING UP THE GAME</h1>

    <p>The Tournament Game set up is slightly altered as follows.</p>
    <p>After the German player sets up his pieces (Step 4), the Russian player may redeploy some, none or all his three "reserve" armies (i.e., those not in a German ZOC) located in hexes 0503, 0608, and 0803 (Mozhaisk).</p>
    <p>These reserve armies can be repositioned - that is, placed one per hex in hexes east of the Russian "Front Line" (i.e., the Russian units already set up on the map) and <strong>not</strong> in a German ZOC. Afterward, the game begins as usual with the German Combat Phase of Game Turn 1.</p>
